# üéâ New Features - Aggregation & Dynamic Filtering

## ‚ú® What's New

Your Claims Investigation Tool has been **significantly enhanced** with two powerful features:

### 1. üìä Aggregation Queries
Summarize data with SQL-style GROUP BY and aggregate functions

### 2. üéØ Dynamic Filtering
Filter data by column values with auto-populated options

## üöÄ Quick Access

**URL**: `/app/investigation/claims`

**New Tabs**:
- **Aggregation** - Build GROUP BY queries
- **Filters** - Add dynamic filters

## üìä Aggregation Tab

### What It Does
Instead of viewing raw rows, **summarize data** by grouping and aggregating.

### Quick Example
**Summarize by Provider:**
```
1. Go to Aggregation Tab
2. GROUP BY: billing_provider_name
3. Aggregations: 
   - COUNT(*) ‚Üí total procedures
   - SUM(charge_total) ‚Üí total charges
4. Run Query
```

**Result:**
```
Provider Name              | Total Procedures | Total Charges
---------------------------|------------------|---------------
ACCENTCARE MEDICAL GROUP   | 1,234           | $125,430
AUTUMN LAKE HEALTHCARE     | 567             | $67,890
```

### Available Functions

| Function | Use For | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **COUNT** | Count rows | How many procedures? |
| **SUM** | Add up values | Total charges? |
| **AVG** | Average value | Average charge per claim? |
| **MIN** | Minimum value | Lowest charge? |
| **MAX** | Maximum value | Highest charge? |
| **COUNT DISTINCT** | Count unique | How many unique providers? |

### Common Aggregation Patterns

**By Provider:**
```
GROUP BY: billing_provider_name
‚Üí One row per provider
```

**By Service Line:**
```
GROUP BY: service_line_description
‚Üí One row per service line
```

**By Provider AND Service Line:**
```
GROUP BY: billing_provider_name, service_line_description
‚Üí One row per provider/service combination
```

**By Demographics:**
```
GROUP BY: patient_age_bracket, patient_gender
‚Üí One row per age/gender combination
```

**By Time:**
```
GROUP BY: date__month_grain
‚Üí One row per month
```

## üéØ Filters Tab

### What It Does
**Narrow down data** by filtering to specific column values. The tool automatically fetches available values from your data!

### Quick Example
**Filter to Physical Therapy Only:**
```
1. Go to Filters Tab
2. Click "Select a column to filter"
3. Choose: service_line_description
4. Tool fetches available service lines
5. Select: "Physical Therapy"
6. Run any query ‚Üí only shows PT data
```

### How Filters Work

**Auto-Populated Options:**
- Tool queries database for distinct values
- Shows value + count (e.g., "Physical Therapy (234)")
- Only shows values that exist in your data
- Updates based on current NPIs

**Multiple Filters:**
- Add as many filters as needed
- Filters are AND'ed together
- Clear individual filters or all at once

### Common Filter Combinations

**Filter 1: By Service Line**
```
service_line_description = "Surgery"
‚Üí Only surgical procedures
```

**Filter 2: By Payor**
```
payor_group = "Medicare"
‚Üí Only Medicare claims
```

**Filter 3: By Demographics**
```
patient_age_bracket = "65-84"
patient_gender = "Female"
‚Üí Only female patients 65-84
```

**Filter 4: By Location**
```
billing_provider_state = "CT"
‚Üí Only Connecticut providers
```

## üî• Powerful Combinations

### Combo 1: Filtered Aggregation
```
Filters: 
- service_line_description = "Surgery"
- payor_group = "Medicare"

Aggregation:
- GROUP BY: billing_provider_name
- Aggregations: COUNT(*), SUM(charge_total)

Result: Provider surgery totals for Medicare only
```

### Combo 2: Multi-Level Grouping with Filters
```
Filters:
- patient_age_bracket = "65-84"

Aggregation:
- GROUP BY: 
  * billing_provider_name
  * service_line_description
- Aggregations: COUNT(*), AVG(charge_total)

Result: Provider/service breakdown for seniors
```

### Combo 3: Temporal Analysis with Filters
```
Filters:
- service_line_description = "Physical Therapy"
- billing_provider_state = "CT"

Aggregation:
- GROUP BY: date__month_grain
- Aggregations: COUNT(*), SUM(charge_total)

Result: Monthly PT volume for CT providers
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Aggregation
For analysis, skip raw data and go straight to aggregation for summaries.

### Tip 2: Use Filters to Focus
Add filters before aggregating to get precise insights faster.

### Tip 3: Multiple Aggregations
Don't limit yourself to one aggregation - add COUNT, SUM, AVG together!

### Tip 4: Export Results
All aggregated data can be exported to CSV for further analysis.

### Tip 5: Experiment Freely
Tool is standalone - experiment without affecting your main app!

## üîÑ Typical Workflows

### Workflow 1: Explore ‚Üí Aggregate
1. Query raw data to understand structure
2. Switch to Aggregation tab
3. GROUP BY interesting columns
4. Analyze summary results

### Workflow 2: Filter ‚Üí Aggregate
1. Go to Filters tab
2. Add relevant filters
3. Go to Aggregation tab
4. Summarize filtered data

### Workflow 3: Iterate Analysis
1. Run initial aggregation
2. Spot interesting pattern
3. Add filter based on pattern
4. Re-run to drill deeper
5. Repeat as needed

## üéì Learning Path

**Day 1: Basics**
- Try simple aggregation (GROUP BY one column)
- Add one filter
- Export results

**Day 2: Intermediate**
- GROUP BY multiple columns
- Try different aggregate functions
- Combine filters

**Day 3: Advanced**
- Multi-level hierarchical grouping
- Complex filter combinations
- Temporal analysis

## ‚ö° Performance Notes

- **Fewer GROUP BY columns** = Faster queries
- **Filters before aggregation** = More efficient
- **Limit still applies** = Top 100 results by default
- **Start small** = Test with small limits first
