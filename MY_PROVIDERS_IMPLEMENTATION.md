# My Providers Implementation

## Overview

The "My Providers" functionality allows users to tag providers globally across all markets, separate from market-specific tagging. This enables users to maintain a list of their own providers that will be automatically marked as "My Locations" when creating experimental markets.

## Key Features

### 1. Global Provider Tagging
- Users can tag providers as "My Providers" from any provider detail page
- These tags persist across all markets and sessions
- Providers tagged as "My Providers" are automatically marked as "Me" in experimental markets

### 2. My Providers Management Page
- Dedicated page at `/app/my-providers` for managing tagged providers
- Search, filter, and sort functionality
- Easy removal of providers from the list
- Direct navigation to provider detail pages

### 3. Automatic Market Integration
- When creating experimental markets, user providers are automatically tagged as "Me"
- Seamless integration with existing experimental market functionality
- No manual tagging required for user providers

## Database Schema

### user_providers Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_providers (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  provider_dhc TEXT NOT NULL, -- BigQuery dhc value
  provider_name TEXT,
  provider_type TEXT,
  provider_network TEXT,
  provider_city TEXT,
  provider_state TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, provider_dhc)
);
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. React Hook: useUserProviders
Location: `src/hooks/useUserProviders.js`

Provides the following functionality:
- `userProviders`: Array of user's tagged providers
- `loading`: Loading state
- `error`: Error state
- `addingProvider`: Loading state for adding providers
- `removingProvider`: Loading state for removing providers
- `addUserProvider(provider)`: Add provider to user's list
- `removeUserProvider(providerDhc)`: Remove provider from user's list
- `isUserProvider(providerDhc)`: Check if provider is in user's list
- `getUserProvider(providerDhc)`: Get user provider by DHC
- `refreshUserProviders()`: Refresh the provider list

### 2. My Providers Page
Location: `src/pages/Private/MyProvidersPage.jsx`

Features:
- Grid layout showing all user providers
- Search functionality
- Filter by provider type
- Sort by name, type, network, location, or date
- Remove providers with confirmation
- Navigate to provider detail pages

### 3. Provider Listing Integration
Location: `src/pages/Private/ProviderListingTab.jsx`

Added "My Providers" column with:
- Add/Remove buttons for each provider
- Visual indication of user provider status
- Loading states during operations

### 4. Experimental Market Integration
Location: `src/pages/Private/ExperimentalMarketMode/MarketOverview.jsx`

Automatic tagging:
- User providers are automatically tagged as "Me" when viewing markets
- Integration with existing experimental market tagging system
- No manual intervention required

## Usage Flow

### 1. Tagging Providers
1. Navigate to any provider detail page
2. In the Provider Listing tab, click "Add" in the "My Providers" column
3. Provider is added to user's global list

### 2. Managing My Providers
1. Navigate to "My Providers" from the main navigation
2. Use search and filters to find specific providers
3. Click "Remove" to remove providers from the list
4. Click "View Details" to navigate to provider pages

### 3. Creating Markets
1. Create an experimental market
2. User providers in the market area are automatically tagged as "Me"
3. No additional steps required

## Navigation Integration

### Main Navigation
Added "My Providers" link to the main navigation bar.

### Quick Links
Added "My Providers" button to the home page quick links sidebar.

## Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only view their own providers
- Users can only add/remove their own providers
- Proper authentication checks on all operations

### Data Validation
- Provider DHC values are validated
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate entries
- Proper error handling throughout

## Testing

### Test Script
Location: `test_my_providers.js`

Tests:
1. Table existence and structure
2. Provider addition functionality
3. Provider retrieval
4. Provider removal
5. RLS policy enforcement

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing experimental markets continue to work
- No changes to existing provider tagging in saved markets
- All existing functionality preserved

## Conclusion

The My Providers functionality provides a seamless way for users to manage their provider relationships globally while maintaining deep integration with the experimental market system. This creates a more efficient workflow for organizations with multiple locations and complex market relationships.
