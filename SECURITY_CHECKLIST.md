## Post-Deployment Verification

### Test User Access Control

### Test Database Policies
- [ ] Users cannot access other users' profiles
- [ ] Users cannot access other teams' data
- [ ] Users cannot modify data they shouldn't have access to
- [ ] Public data (announcements) is readable by all

## Security Monitoring

### Set Up Monitoring
- [ ] Security events are being logged
- [ ] `security_events` view is accessible
- [ ] Failed login attempts are tracked
- [ ] Unusual access patterns are monitored

### Regular Security Tasks
- [ ] Review access logs weekly
- [ ] Check for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Monitor for unusual data access patterns
- [ ] Review user permissions monthly
- [ ] Update security policies as needed

## Production Security Checklist

### Environment Security
- [ ] All secrets are stored in environment variables
- [ ] No secrets are committed to version control
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled for all communications
- [ ] CORS is configured with specific origins only

### User Management
- [ ] Strong password policies are enforced
- [ ] Two-factor authentication is available (if applicable)

- [ ] Inactive accounts are deactivated

### Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] Data backups are secure
- [ ] Data retention policies are in place
- [ ] GDPR compliance measures are implemented (if applicable)

## Quick Security Tests

### Test 1: User Isolation
```sql
-- Run as different users to verify they can't see each other's data
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id != auth.uid();
-- Should return empty for regular users
```

### Test 2: Team Isolation
```sql
-- Verify team members can't access other teams' data
SELECT * FROM team_provider_tags WHERE team_id != auth.get_team_id();
-- Should return empty for team members
```

### Test 3: Admin Access
```sql
-- Verify platform admins can see all data
SELECT auth.is_platform_admin();
-- Should return true for platform admins
```

### Test 4: Security Functions
```sql
-- Test security helper functions
SELECT auth.is_authenticated();
SELECT auth.get_team_id();
SELECT auth.get_user_permissions();
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Breach Response
1. [ ] Immediately isolate affected systems
2. [ ] Assess the scope and impact of the breach
3. [ ] Notify affected users if required
4. [ ] Investigate the root cause
5. [ ] Implement additional security measures
6. [ ] Document the incident and lessons learned

### Contact Information
- [ ] Security team contact is established
- [ ] Emergency contact procedures are in place
- [ ] Incident response plan is documented

## Compliance Checklist

### Data Protection
- [ ] Data retention policies are documented
- [ ] Data deletion procedures are in place
- [ ] User consent mechanisms are implemented
- [ ] Data processing is documented

### Audit Requirements
- [ ] Access logs are maintained for required period
- [ ] Change logs are kept for security modifications
- [ ] Incident reports are documented
- [ ] Regular security audits are scheduled
