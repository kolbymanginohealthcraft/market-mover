I've created 5 professional color schemes to replace the yellow/orange. Here are the options:

## üé® Option 1: Professional Blue (Current)
**Colors:** Blue gradient (#3b82f6 to #1d4ed8)
**Best for:** Corporate environments, trust-building, professional services

## üè• Option 2: Healthcare Green
**Colors:** Green gradient (#10b981 to #059669)
**Best for:** Healthcare industry, wellness, growth, positive outcomes
**Preview:** Fresh green gradient that feels medical/healthcare appropriate

## üè¢ Option 3: Modern Gray
**Colors:** Gray gradient (#6b7280 to #4b5563)
**Best for:** Conservative industries, finance, law, understated elegance
**Preview:** Sophisticated gray that's very professional and neutral

## ü§ù Option 4: Trustworthy Teal
**Colors:** Teal gradient (#14b8a6 to #0d9488)

## üîÑ How to Switch Colors

To change the color scheme, edit `src/components/Banner.module.css`:

1. **Comment out** the current option (Option 1)
2. **Uncomment** your preferred option (Options 2-5)

Example - to switch to Healthcare Green:
```css
.banner {
  /* Option 1: Professional Blue (Current) - COMMENT OUT */
  /* background: linear-gradient(135deg, #3b82f6 0%, #1d4ed8 100%);
  color: #ffffff;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.2);
  border: 2px dashed rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3); */
  
  /* Option 2: Healthcare Green - UNCOMMENT THIS */
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #10b981 0%, #059669 100%);
  color: #ffffff;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.2);
  border: 2px dashed rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
  
  /* ... other options remain commented ... */
}
```

## üéØ Recommendations

- **Healthcare Industry:** Option 2 (Green) or Option 4 (Teal)
- **Corporate/Finance:** Option 3 (Gray) or Option 1 (Blue)
- **Technology/Innovation:** Option 4 (Teal) or Option 5 (Purple)
- **Conservative:** Option 3 (Gray)
- **Modern/Professional:** Option 1 (Blue) or Option 4 (Teal)

## üöÄ Additional Improvements

You could also consider:

1. **Removing the dashed border** for a cleaner look
2. **Adding a subtle animation** on hover
3. **Using different icons** that match the color scheme
4. **Adding a subtle pattern** overlay for more visual interest

Let me know which option you prefer, and I can implement it immediately!
