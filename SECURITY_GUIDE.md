# Security Guide for Market Mover

## Overview
This guide outlines the security measures implemented in the Market Mover application and provides best practices for maintaining a secure environment.

## Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation

### What is RLS?
Row Level Security is a PostgreSQL feature that restricts which rows users can access in database tables. It ensures that users can only see and modify data they're authorized to access.

### Security Policies Implemented

#### User Data Protection
- **Profiles**: Users can only view and update their own profile
- **User Activities**: Users can only see their own activity logs
- **User Testimonials**: Users can only manage their own testimonials

#### Team-Based Access Control
- **Teams**: Users can only view their own team information
- **Team Provider Tags**: Team members can only access their team's provider tags
- **Team Custom Colors**: Team members can only manage their team's custom colors
- **Markets**: Users can only access their own saved markets

#### Role-Based Access Control
- **Platform Admins**: Can view and manage all data across the platform
- **Team Admins**: Can view team member profiles and manage team settings
- **Team Members**: Limited to their own data and team-specific data

#### Billing and Subscription Security
- **Subscriptions**: Team members can only view their team's subscription
- **Invoices**: Team members can only view their team's invoices
- **Payments**: Team members can only view their team's payment history
- **License Add-ons**: Team members can only view their team's license add-ons

#### Public Data (Read-Only)
- **System Announcements**: All users can view system announcements
- **Feature Requests**: All users can view and create feature requests
- **Policy Definitions**: All users can view policy definitions

## Security Functions

### Authentication Helpers
```sql
-- Check if user is authenticated
auth.is_authenticated()

-- Get current user's team ID
auth.get_team_id()

-- Check if user is platform admin
auth.is_platform_admin()
```

## API Security

### Supabase Functions
- **JWT Verification**: All functions that handle sensitive data verify JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access**: Functions check user roles before performing operations
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks

### Edge Functions Security
- **Authentication Required**: Most functions require valid JWT tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Sanitization**: All inputs are sanitized before processing

## Environment Security

### Environment Variables
- **Database URLs**: Never commit database URLs to version control
- **API Keys**: Store all API keys in environment variables
- **JWT Secrets**: Keep JWT secrets secure and rotate regularly

### File Security
- **Service Account Files**: Store in secure location, not in version control
- **Credentials**: Use environment variables for all credentials

## Best Practices

### Development
1. **Never disable RLS** in production
2. **Test security policies** thoroughly before deployment
3. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
4. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server side
5. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information

### Deployment
1. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
2. **Enable CORS** with specific origins only
3. **Implement rate limiting** on all endpoints
4. **Monitor access logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Regular security audits** of policies and permissions

### User Management
1. **Implement strong password policies**
2. **Enable two-factor authentication** where possible
3. **Regular role reviews** to ensure proper access
4. **Immediate deactivation** of inactive accounts
5. **Audit trail** for all user actions

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Security Monitoring
- **Failed login attempts**
- **Unusual access patterns**
- **Policy violations**
- **Data access outside normal hours**

### Regular Security Tasks
- **Review access logs** weekly
- **Update security policies** monthly
- **Rotate API keys** quarterly
- **Security audit** annually

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Response
1. **Immediate isolation** of affected systems
2. **Assessment** of breach scope and impact
3. **Notification** of affected users if required
4. **Investigation** of root cause
5. **Implementation** of additional security measures
6. **Documentation** of incident and lessons learned

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- **GDPR Compliance**: Implement data retention and deletion policies
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Ensure healthcare data is properly protected
- **SOC 2**: Maintain security controls for compliance

### Audit Requirements
- **Access logs** maintained for 7 years
- **Change logs** for all security policy modifications
- **Incident reports** for all security events
